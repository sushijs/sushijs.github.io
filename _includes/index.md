[SushiJS](http://www.sushijs.org) is a meetup designed to bring JavaScript developers together through sushi and conversation.

## Why Sushi?

> Many meetups are designed to disseminate information, but not bring communities together. However, talking with other people over food became my favorite part of meetups and conferences, so I decided to make a “eatup” built around that.
